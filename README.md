# Using the Closure Compiler in Advanced Mode with The Dojo Toolkit

This project documents the steps to use the Closure Compiler in Advanced Mode with The Dojo Toolkit.
Currently supported for Dojo version 1.6.

**Sorry, I am no longer updating this project.**

There are a few reasons:

1) Dojo has progressed rapidly, and fixing it up for Closure is a losing game,
2) JavaScript engines have improved and now a lot of Closure optimizations are not crucial,
3) mobile browsers have improved so that Closure optimizations are also not crucial,
4) even Google is moving to Dart and not staying with raw JavaScript,
5) some Closure optimizations may actually defeat modern browsers' optimizations.
 
As a result, version 1.6 is the last version of Dojo that I am supporting for the Closure compiler.
